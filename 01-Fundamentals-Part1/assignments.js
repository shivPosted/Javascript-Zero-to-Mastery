//assignment-01
// 1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and
// assign their values according to your own country (population in millions)
// 2. Log their values to the console

const country = "India";
const continent = "Asia";
let population = "1,406 millions"
// console.log("result of assignment-01")
// console.log(country);
// console.log(continent);
// console.log(population);


//Assignment-02
// 1. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your
// country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable
// 'language', but don't assign it any value yet
// 2. Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language'
// to the console

const isIsland = false;
let language;
// console.log("assignment");
// console.log(typeof isIsland);
// console.log(typeof language);
// console.log(typeof country);
// console.log(typeof population);

//Assignment-03
// 1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some
//     countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)
//     2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never
//     change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
//     3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens


console.log("Assignmet");
language = "Hindi";
country = "UK";
